# N-Body-Particle-Simulation
I plan to create an n-body simulation and have at least one version mimic the solar system.

gravity
I will start with the default mpi.cpp code but modify the apply force function to attract instead of bounce.
I removed the summary. I removed the checks. I'm keeping the positions. I'll probably keep the size and fix size by the density as it has it already. The benefiet of this is that you can see similar results at different scales.
